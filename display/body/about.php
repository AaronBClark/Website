			<p style="margin-top: 50px;">The Software Engineering Club at Moreno Valley College
			promotes teamwork, teaches industry standard collaboration techniques, and solidifies the skills of
			computer science students by hosting periodic software development marathons in which the 
			goal will be to conceptualize, design, and produce a unique application as a group in a single
			session.</p>

			<p>A variety of software development topics ranging from basic to advanced
			will be presented by qualified speakers. These new 
			skills will be put to the test in fun-filled group exercises and competitions.</p>
			<p>Also, we have cake.</p>
