				<h3>Who We Are</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						We're a group of students who attend Moreno Valley College and are dedicated 
						to advancing their knowledge of programming and software development, and 
						project management. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Our leadership is comprised of computer science tutors and supplimental 
						instructors, and our memberbase is mainly comprised of computer science 
						students with an intermediate level of skill.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>What We Do</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Everything we do is geared toward making an impact both in our careers and in
						our community. We meet every week to organize projects, learn new techniques,
						and plan events. There's always something new and challenging for
						us to work on.
					</p>
					<ul style="text-align: left;">
						<li>
							&#8226; Creating applications to improve the lives of our fellow students.
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							&#8226; Organizing, creating, and presenting lectures on information security
							to help curb the plague of identity theft.

					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3>How We Do It</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						We have a learning-centric culture, and are constantly exploring new 
						things to share with the team. Several members have surpassed the 
						school's curriculum, and give lectures on advanced topics that can
						be used in future projects. In addition, crash courses are given
						prior to any major project to keep everyone on the same page.
					</p>
					<p>
						For projects in progress, we use Github. Git is software used for 
						collaboration that makes versioning simple, and Github is our
						preferred interface as it includes several social features that 
						make working together easier.
					</p>
				</div>
