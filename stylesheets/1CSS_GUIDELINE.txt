TEXT WRAPPING BASED ON SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR TABBING

WHY HAVE A GUIDELINE?
	This will help us have a common ground on structuring our code
	to have better understanding and legibility... trust, when the code
	becomes 300+ line, it's going to get harder to read

* Use comment line(s) to create a brief description of the contribution.
* add class AND id attributes on HTML tags to be use on css whenever possible:
	|-> use hungarianStyleNamingConvension
	|-> use discriptive name such as: contactButton, loginTextField
	|-> WHY? this way we have FULL CONTROL on what to edit.
* TAB! TAB! TAB!
	|-> indent your code
	|-> tab your propeties and values in alignment with other grouped properties
	|-> sample:
			body
			{
				float:			right;
				border-radius 	2em;
			}
			body a 
			{
				text-align:			left;
				background-images:	url('location/of/image.png');
			}
* USE HEX for colour code except when:
	* rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); when need alpha channel
	* red 	for DEBUGGING
* DO NOT USE CONSTANT DEFINED COLOURS!
